Summary: Threaded Array Summation with POSIX Threads and Semaphores

This C program demonstrates the use of POSIX threads and semaphores to perform parallel computation on a large array. The task is to sum 1 billion elements, and the array is divided into four equal parts. Four threads are created, with each thread responsible for summing one-quarter of the array. The results are then combined into a shared variable, overall_sum. Since multiple threads concurrently update overall_sum, a binary semaphore is used to ensure safe updates by locking the shared variable during the update operation, preventing race conditions. The program showcases the advantage of parallelism in multi-threaded applications, improving computation time, while maintaining the integrity of shared data with the help of semaphores.
